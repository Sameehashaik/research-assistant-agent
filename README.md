# Research Assistant Agent

Agentic system that intelligently chooses between searching documents and the web.

## Status: Phase 1/8

## What Makes This "Agentic"?

Unlike simple RAG (always searches docs), this system:
- **Thinks** before acting (which tool to use?)
- **Chooses** appropriate tools
- **Combines** multiple sources
- **Reasons** about what it knows

## Tech Stack
- LangGraph (agent orchestration)
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (reasoning)
- FAISS (document search)
- Tavily (web search)
- Streamlit (chat UI)

## Architecture
[Will add after Phase 2]
